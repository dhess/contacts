                         README for contacts

The utility contacts gives you access to view and search all your records in the AddressBook database.  

To install contacts, double click the contacts1.1.pkg and follow the instructions.  To uninstall contacts, run the following commands (if you're installing contacts, you should be somewhat comfortable with the command line):

$ rm /usr/bin/contacts
$ rm /usr/share/man/man1/contacts.1

With version 1.1, contacts is now installed in /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin; the '-S' option was added; firstname first or vice versa is now handled correctly; added the notes to the search fields; added tokens to access addresses (i.e.  '%a', '%ha', etc); added '%u' token to access unique identifier for each person. 

Without further ado, here are a few examples:

$ contacts -h
usage: contacts [-hHsmnlS] [-c|-f format] [search]
      -h displays help (this)
      -H suppress header
      -s sort list
      -m show me
      -n displays note below each record
      -l loose formatting (doesn't truncate record values)
      -S strict formatting (doesn't add space between columns)
      -c output as calendar(1) file format
      -f accepts a format string (see man page)
