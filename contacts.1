.Sh BUGS              \" Document known, unremedied bugs 
contacts only searches the first name, last name, email, company name,
AIM name, and notes in the AddressBook, whereas the AddressBook
application's behavior appears to search everything in the record.
.Pp
.Sh HISTORY           \" Document history if command behaves in a unique manner
With version 1.1, contacts is now installed in /usr/bin instead of
/usr/local/bin; the '-S' option was added; firstname first or vice
versa is now handled correctly; added the notes to the search fields;
added tokens to access addresses (i.e.  '%a', '%ha', etc); added '%u'
token to access unique identifier for each person.
